            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Burger Shot started as a small family-owned burger joint in the heart of New York City. With just a few tables and a passion for quality ingredients, we quickly became a favorite spot for locals. Today, we’ve grown to over 50 locations nationwide, but our commitment to quality remains the same.</p>

That means fresh, never frozen beef, locally sourced produce, and homemade sauces that add a unique twist to our classic recipes. Whether you’re in the mood for our signature "Big Shot" burger or something lighter like the "Mini Shot," there’s something for everyone on our menu.</p>
